# SynaLinks: The safiest way to Artificial General Intelligence

SynaLinks is a French startup founded in 2023 following the scientific advancements made in natural language processing in recent years. Emerging from the French technological hub, we advocate for a thoughtful and pragmatic use of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). By combining language models with a traditional branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) known as symbolic AI, we aim to explain and represent problems in a human-comprehensible form.

At SynaLinks, our mission is to shape an ethical and responsible future for hybrid AGI. Leveraging our expertise in robotics and human-robot interaction, we strive to create AGIs that interact harmoniously with humans while offering the advanced functionalities of deep learning and symbolic AI. We are committed to developing ethical, transparent, and secure AI solutions to address the most complex challenges of our society.

As part of this mission, we are currently developing several free and open-source products:

- **[SymboLinks](https://github.com/SynaLinks/SymboLinks)**: A hybrid vector and graph database for AGI systems built on Redis, an open-source and local database system, allowing businesses to retain control over their sensitive data.

- **[HybridAGI](https://github.com/SynaLinks/HybridAGI)**: A programmable neuro-symbolic AGI system, that can operate safely, available under a free and open-source license.

- **[HybridAGI-library](https://github.com/SynaLinks/HybridAGI-library)**: A collection of curated programs to help your build your own HybridAGI.

Obviously, more projects focused on these aspects will emerges.. stay tuned !

For businesses, we offer a range of services, including:

- **Prompt Engineer Training**: To assist companies in automating their internal processes using HybridAGI.
- **Business and Institutional Consulting**: To assess risks and opportunities related to AGI and guide them in implementing ethical AI.
- **Cybersecurity Training Based on these Technologies**: To help companies strengthen their security posture against potential AGI-related threats.
- **Red Teaming Services based on these Technologies**: To test and improve the resilience of their systems against cyberattacks using these technologies.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Strengthening Core Functionality

In this phase, our primary focus will be on improving the core capabilities of the system to ensure a robust foundation for future developments.

- **Enhancing Self-Programming Capabilities**:
We are committed to pushing the boundaries of our system's self-programming capabilities. By leveraging HybridAGI graph programs, we aim to enable our system to imagine, develop and test its own graph programs. This means the system will become more efficient, adaptive, and capable of handling a broader range of tasks.

- **Enhancing Retrieval Capabilities**:
Efficient and accurate retrieval of information is essential. We'll work on optimizing our retrieval algorithms, speeding up the search process and providing users with more relevant results from the metagraph and hybridstore.

- **Developing a Fast Text-Only Language Model (LLM) with Large Context Size**:
In the context of HybridAGI, we recognize the significance of a dedicated language model tailored to text-based tasks. We will focus on creating an ultra-fast LLMs capable of processing vast amounts of text data efficiently. This LLM will be designed with extra-large context size, enabling HybridAGI to reason on longer programs and provide more accurate responses. We plan to train two different LLM, one for decision making and the other for acting allowing us to optimize speed and efficiency.

### Phase 2: Multimodal Support

Building on the strengthened core, we will focus on introducing multimodal support to the system, opening up exciting possibilities for diverse data types.

- **Adding Multimodal Support into the Metagraph and Hybridstore**:
We'll integrate support for various data modalities, including images, audio, and more. This enhancement will enable users to work with a rich array of data, enhancing the versatility and utility of the system.

- **Integrating External Tools for Multimodal Support**:
To ensure seamless handling and processing of different data modalities, we will collaborate with external tools and libraries specialized in multimodal data. This integration will allow users to leverage cutting-edge technologies within our system.
